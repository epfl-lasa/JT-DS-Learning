This version of the manuscript is an improvement w.r.t. the first one.
The changes made by the authors are effective in addressing this
reviewer's comments raised previously and made the paper clearer and
more readable; I also reviewed the clarifications in the answers to my
previous concerns with which I'm satisfied. Moreover, I also reviewed
the additions made by the authors, and I find that the paper can be
accepted as it is.
