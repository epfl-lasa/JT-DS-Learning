Cover Note for RA-L Submission

I, Nadia Figueroa, on behalf of my co-authors, hereby submit the manuscript of our recent work entitled "Learning Augmented Joint-Space Task-Oriented Dynamical Systems: A Linear Parameter Varying and Synergetic Control Approach" to the Special Issue on Learning and Control for Autonomous Manipulation Systems: the Role of Dimensionality Reduction. 

In the presented manuscript, we propose an asymptotically stable joint-space dynamical system that captures desired behaviors in joint-space while stably converging towards a task-space attractor. To encode joint-space behaviors while meeting the stability criteria, the dynamical system is constructed as a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system combining different motor synergies, and we provide a method for learning these synergy matrices from demonstrations. Specifically, we use dimensionality reduction to find a low-dimensional embedding space for modulating joint synergies, and then estimate the parameters of the corresponding synergies by solving a convex semi-definite optimization problem that minimizes the joint velocity prediction error from the demonstrations. We believe the presented contributions are highly relevant to this journal and specifically to this Special Issue. 

I hereby certify that this work is original in its content, not under review or published at any other journal/conference and does not impose any conflict of interest with the editorial board.

With best regards,

Nadia Figueroa
