# Jacobian and differential motion demonstration
#
# A differential motion can be represented by a 6-element vector with elements
# [dx dy dz drx dry drz]
#
# where the first 3 elements are a differential translation, and the last 3 
# are a differential rotation.  When dealing with infinitisimal rotations, 
# the order becomes unimportant.  The differential motion could be written 
# in terms of compounded transforms
#
# transl(dx,dy,dz) * rotx(drx) * roty(dry) * rotz(drz)
#
# but a more direct approach is to use the function diff2tr()
#
    D = mat([.1, .2, 0, -.2, .1, .1]).T;
    skew(D)

#
# More commonly it is useful to know how a differential motion in one 
# coordinate frame appears in another frame.  If the second frame is 
# represented by the transform
    T = transl(100, 200, 300) * troty(pi/8) * trotz(-pi/4);
#
# then the differential motion in the second frame would be given by

    DT = tr2jac(T) * D;
    DT.T
#
# tr2jac() has computed a 6x6 Jacobian matrix which transforms the differential 
# changes from the first frame to the next.

# The manipulator's Jacobian matrix relates differential joint coordinate 
# motion to differential Cartesian motion;
#
# 	dX = J(q) dQ
#
# For an n-joint manipulator the manipulator Jacobian is a 6 x n matrix and
# is used is many manipulator control schemes.  For a 6-axis manipulator like
# the Puma 560 the Jacobian is square.
#
# We import the robot model
    from robot.puma560 import *
#
# Two Jacobians are frequently used, which express the Cartesian velocity in
# the world coordinate frame,

    q = [0.1, 0.75, -2.25, 0, .75, 0]
    J = jacob0(p560, q)
#
# or the T6 coordinate frame

    J = jacobn(p560, q)
#
# Note the top right 3x3 block is all zero.  This indicates, correctly, that
# motion of joints 4-6 does not cause any translational motion of the robot's
# end-effector.

#
#  Many control schemes require the inverse of the Jacobian.  The Jacobian
# in this example is not singular
    linalg.det(J)
#
# and may be inverted
    Ji = inv(J)
pause % any key to continue
#
# A classic control technique is Whitney's resolved rate motion control
#
# dQ/dt = J(q)^-1 dX/dt
#
# where dX/dt is the desired Cartesian velocity, and dQ/dt is the required
# joint velocity to achieve this.
#
# We demand pure translational motion in the X direction
    vel = mat([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).T;

# and "resolve" this into joint rates
    qvel = Ji * vel;
    qvel.T
#
#  This is an alternative strategy to computing a Cartesian trajectory 
# and solving the inverse kinematics.  However like that other scheme, this
# strategy also runs into difficulty at a manipulator singularity where
# the Jacobian is singular.

#
# As already stated this Jacobian relates joint velocity to end-effector 
# velocity expressed in the end-effector reference frame.  We may wish 
# instead to specify the velocity in base or world coordinates.
#
# We have already seen how differential motions in one frame can be translated 
# to another.  Consider the velocity as a differential in the world frame, that
# is, d0X.  We can write
# 	d6X = Jac(T6) d0X
#
    T6 = fkine(p560, q); % compute the end-effector transform
    d6X = tr2jac(T6) * vel; % translate world frame velocity to T6 frame
    qvel = Ji * d6X; % compute required joint velocity as before
    qvel.T
#
# Note that this value of joint velocity is quite different to that calculated
# above, which was for motion in the T6 X-axis direction.

#
#  At a manipulator singularity or degeneracy the Jacobian becomes singular.
# At the Puma's `ready' position for instance, two of the wrist joints are
# aligned resulting in the loss of one degree of freedom.  This is revealed by
# the rank of the Jacobian
    rank( jacobn(p560, qr) )
#
# and the singular values are
    linalg.svd( jacobn(p560, qr) )
pause % any key to continue
#
# When not actually at a singularity the Jacobian can provide information 
# about how `well-conditioned' the manipulator is for making certain motions,
# and is referred to as `manipulability'.
#
# A number of scalar manipulability measures have been proposed.  One by
# Yoshikawa
    manipulability(p560, q, 'yoshikawa')
#
# is based purely on kinematic parameters of the manipulator.
#
# Another by Asada takes into account the inertia of the manipulator which 
# affects the acceleration achievable in different directions.  This measure 
# varies from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates uniformity of acceleration in all 
# directions
    manipulability(p560, q, 'asada')
#
# Both of these measures would indicate that this particular pose is not well
# conditioned.

# An interesting class of manipulators are those that are redundant, that is,
# they have more than 6 degrees of freedom.  Computing the joint motion for
# such a manipulator is not straightforward.  Approaches have been suggested
# based on the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian (which will not be square) or
# singular value decomposition of the Jacobian.
