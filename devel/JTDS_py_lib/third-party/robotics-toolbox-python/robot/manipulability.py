    MANIPLTY Manipulability measure

        - M = MANIPLTY(ROBOT, Q)
        - M = MANIPLTY(ROBOT, Q, WHICH)

    Computes the manipulability index for the manipulator at the given pose.

    For an n-axis manipulator Q may be an n-element vector, or an m x n
    joint space trajectory.

    If Q is a vector MANIPLTY returns a scalar manipulability index.
    If Q is a matrix MANIPLTY returns a column vector of  manipulability 
    indices for each pose specified by Q.

    The argument WHICH can be either 'yoshikawa' (default) or 'asada' and
    selects one of two manipulability measures.
    Yoshikawa's manipulability measure gives an indication of how far 
    the manipulator is from singularities and thus able to move and 
    exert forces uniformly in all directions.

    Asada's manipulability measure is based on the manipulator's
    Cartesian inertia matrix.  An n-dimensional inertia ellipsoid
        X' M(q) X = 1
    gives an indication of how well the manipulator can accelerate
    in each of the Cartesian directions.  The scalar measure computed
    here is the ratio of the smallest/largest ellipsoid axis.  Ideally
    the ellipsoid would be spherical, giving a ratio of 1, but in
    practice will be less than 1.
